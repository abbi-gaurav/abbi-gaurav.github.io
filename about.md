I am a professional Java developer, exploring functional paradigms, learning scala, haskell, akka, play and having fun while doing all this. I believe in TDD, agile programming, writing concise and human readable code. Apart from coding, I also play Table Tennis, like to watch TV Series like BBT, House M.D. and learn Deutsch.
